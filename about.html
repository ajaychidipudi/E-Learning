		<h1>We Are One Of The Worlds's Largest Learning Platforms</h1><br>

		<p> Today E-Learning has caused a revolution in the educational sector globally and remains high in demand. E-Learning tools just keep getting bigger and better. It has certainly provided a larger platform for learners to experience education on a broader and effective level.
        E Learning is the second most used training method among organisations, many companies are moving at a faster rate because of E learning and are breaking away from the traditional way of learning, where an instructor usually conducts the training sessions. The global market for E learning is expected to cross over $100 billion by 2015.
        E-Learning is eco- friendly. Recent studies done by the Open University at Britain have found that E-Learning consumes 90% less energy than traditional courses. Carbon dioxide emissions per students have also reduced by up to 85%.
        25% of all employees leave their jobs mainly due to lack of training and learning opportunities. Whereas, on the other hand companies who do provide E- learning opportunities, generate about 26% more revenue per employee.
        Knowledge retention has increased from 25% to 60% just by E-Learning.
        Companies that incorporate E-Learning are able to save between 50% to 70% when replaced by instructor- based training. E Learning has proven to increase productivity as employees or even students no longer have to travel or rush to catch the bus or train to get to class. </p>
